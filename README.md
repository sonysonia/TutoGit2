# demo2
i'm gonna use this folder for initiate another git, pushing it on my gitHub. so this one is use in a different way from the first one. that means i can create a folder with a new project directly in my local machine and store it in my GitHub account.
the first one is use as taking a repository from my GitHUb account to my local machine, work on it, commit changes and push the repo to validate changes.
